title: About Us
---

Soapbox Music was founded by [Farsheed Hamidi-Toosi](http://zirafaworks.com) and [Brendan Finucane](https://rockthecello.wordpress.com) in 2010 with a mission to build high quality resources for musicians. Since then, our cooperative music studio in Chicago has provided many musicians and audio engineers a quiet and creative space to write, rehearse, and record music without distractions.

In 2017, we expanded our mission to include the realm of music education. We are excited to be working on our first product, the [Chromawheel](http://chromawheelmusic.com), an innovative hands-on way to explore and learn musical concepts.
