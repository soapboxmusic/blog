Soapbox Music co-founders Brendan Finucane and Farsheed Hamidi-Toosi unveiled the Chromawheel, a newly invented instrument that helps students learn music at the Illinois Music Educators Association (ILMEA) annual conference this weekend in Peoria, Illinois.

Long-time creative collaborators, Finucane and Hamidi-Toosi combined their professional experience in classroom and private music teaching, electrical engineering and computer programming to design and build the Chromawheel, incorporating feedback from music students and fellow music educators in each phase of the process.

Their goal is to manufacture an instrument that simplifies musical concepts, in order to lower the barrier to learning music for all students.

Soapbox Music was founded in 2008 with a mission to provide high quality resources for musicians, by musicians. Since 2010, the company has offered local Chicago musicians and audio engineers a unique co-operative studio space to write, rehearse and record music without distractions. The 2017 expansion of the company’s mission into the realm of music education seemed like a logical next step.
