Experimental goodness this Friday! Hailing from Brooklyn, NY Northern Spy's Diamond Terrifier will show us the positive aspects of destruction through noise/drone sheets of sound through his saxophone + other instruments. Patrick Higgins will be performing Bachanalia, a solo classical guitar take on various pieces by JS Bach. Sonic destruction & reconstruction, face melting noise and drones, classical allusions, what's not to like? Dan Godston, Zirafa, and Orange Drink team up with an opening performance as a trio, attempting to free sounds from silence.
