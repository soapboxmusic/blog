[Nullsleep](http://www.nullsleep.com/) played Soapbox a while back (audio coming soon), and if you liked that performance check this out!

> Reformat the Planet (RTP) is a feature length documentary which delves into the movement known as chip music, a vibrant underground scene based around creating new, original music using obsolete video game hardware. Familiar devices such as the Nintendo Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System are pushed in new directions with startling results.

Our good friends at [Two Player Productions](http://www.2playerproductions.com/) created this full length documentary and it is FINALLY about to be released on DVD soon! Combo packs with shirts, stickers, buttons, a poster, and other 2PP products are also available.
