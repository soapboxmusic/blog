Elsinore openers [Canasta](http://www.canastamusic.com/) put on quite a show last night at Lincoln Hall.  Tight, high-energy, nine-member band with extended horn section, great scoring, dual keyboards, well-crafted vocal harmonies, electric violinist, charismatic lead vocalist-- all the pieces were there.  Check these guys out at their next Chicago shows -- aug. 27th at Transmission and October 3rd at Beat Kitchen.
