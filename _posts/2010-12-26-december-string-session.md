Awesome session!  Soapbox resident composer Joe Montanaro set up some mics and captured the whole thing.  We rocked out and also read through the standard 'All The Things You Are', dividing the parts between the celli, viola and violins.  The jazz has lots of potential, though our first attempts were a little shaky.  F#-7b5 ?? We'll do more jazz at the January session!  Here's a couple of short audio clips from the evening.  Thanks to all the awesome musicians who came out!
