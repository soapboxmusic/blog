It's kind of self-evident by this post, but we now have a blog.  For those of you youngins out there, the word "blog" comes from the latin: "blogusito" meaning "to blog".

Naw but seriously in this day and age with social networks being the latest and greatest thing - we at Soapbox Music want to remind everyone that there are ways you can do it yourself which has its own advantages. Nothing wrong with social networks (hey we are on them and use them regularly) but they are pretty unpredictable and aren't a very good way of creating a long term archive of content to share with the world.  Our goal with this blog will be to document and archive the things we do, the interesting people we meet, and of course the amazing music you all are making.
