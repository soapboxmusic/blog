Biggg ups to Kyra and Samantha for an awesome 48 Volts session tonight.   The soprano and cello sounded amazing and the Soapbox live room certainly lived up to the challenge. These two talented musicians are gearing up for back-to-back concerts at the Fine Arts Building on September 27th and 29th.  Check back for an audio preview of their program, video and an interview with the two lovely young artists!
