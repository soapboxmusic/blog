Good times! Soapbox Session #6 was like hanging out in your friend's attic above the garage back in the day. Had some new souls who hadn't the seen the place before - welcome. Come back again soon.

Next session is August 25th...bring your work. Regular open hours next wed, too.

See y'all then.
