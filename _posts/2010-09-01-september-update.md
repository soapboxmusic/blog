Hey ya'll,

It's been a hot summer, but you won't hear us complaining - get outside while the gettin' is good!

### [ NEWS ] 

**HIGHER QUALITY REHEARSALS - 100% Private and Quiet**  
We are no longer allowing multiple rehearsals at the same time - when you book a rehearsal at Soapbox, you will be the only musicians practicing in the building. Which means...NO neighboring bands practicing Metallica covers at full blast, NO outside distractions - just you, your friends and your song ideas.

**SEPTEMBER SPECIAL: Save 50% off all online orders**  
Book your rehearsal online with the promo code: SBXSEPT1250 and save 50% - ONLY $12.50/hr! Monthly rehearsal packages also available, as low as $200/month.**

**ARTIST RESIDENCY: Sound Installation by Eric Laska**  
Eric Laska is a NYC based artist who will be setting up a sound installation based on amplifier hum imported from NYC to Chicago for two nights ONLY at Soapbox.

> "I am importing amplifier hum from New York and playing it on multiple amplifiers at a music rehearsal space in Chicago.  The resultant transcontinental ground loop is equalized and spatialized throughout the amp configuration.  Deep listeners take note: digital artifacts, warm tubes, local interference, phase accidents.  
I call it Chicago Equinix as a 'thank you' to the data center of the same name that sits up the street from Soapbox Music."

Showings: Friday, Sept 24th, 7-midnight @ Soapbox Music (OPENING NIGHT) and Friday, Oct 1, 7-midnight @ Soapbox Music (SECOND SHOWING)
