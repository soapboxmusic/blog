Martyn closed out the first night of Sonar pretty strong with a house-y set.  Some latin flavor in there, a lot of nice minimalist synth stuff.  No pounding kicks (maybe in part due to pritzker's massive tweeter arrays?) or cheesy compression but still dance-y as hell.  [Redthreat](http://redthreat.wordpress.com/2010/09/09/martyn-sonar-chicago-pritzker-pavillion/#more-5808) calls Martyn an innovative dub-step DJ; maybe true but he pretty much eschewed any growling in his set tonight.
