As faithful readers may have noticed, we have not updated this site in quite some time. That is largely because the studio has been busy, and also because we have retired the [48 Volts](48volts) interview series. A big thank you to those that participated and read the interviews, and hopefully we'll be able to bring them back in the future. In the meantime, we encourage folks to check out [Loud Loop Press](http://www.loudlooppress.com), an online publication with excellent interviews with Chicago bands, frequently accompanied with exclusive recordings engineered by Soapbox member [Damian Wiseman](http://damianwiseman.com).

The last couple years have involved lots of change, learning and growth. [Brendan and I](http://blacktieelephant.com/) have a couple new projects in the works for 2016 that we are excited about, and we continue to be amazed by the projects our members are working on. Big shout out to our current members: [Damian Wiseman](http://damianwiseman.com), Nicholas and Nicholas of Brontosaurus, and Arman Abtahi!
