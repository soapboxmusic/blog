Block-rockin beatz by Charlie D  
Farsheedi on the low end  
MJ soulfully crooning, guitars.  
Aaron tickling the alesis  
Jeff with the cameo  
C. Egner on the six string  
Den breathing harp, guitars  
B on musical chairs  

Brewskies, pizza from across the way.

We jammed on some favorite tunes--

Alabamy Slammy and Love In My Oven.

Might post some highlights
