    <h3> Be inspired, get creative</h3>
    <p>A comfortable environment that melts away distractions and focuses your creative mind. Sometimes a place just feels right, and that can make all the difference.</p>

    <h3>Higher Quality Space</h3>
    <p>100% private, acoustically treated, ultra-quiet music space with well-maintained gear. There are no neighboring bands and no distractions of any kind. You will be the only musicians in the building and you'll hear the difference.</p>    
    
    <h3>Acoustically Treated</h3>
    <p>Slapback and flutter echoes make it almost impossible to hear yourself and other musicians with clarity. Our rooms are acoustically treated to improve the bass response and eliminate undesirable echoes.</p>
